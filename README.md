GAME OFF 2019 - https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2019

Theme: LEAPS AND BOUNDS

### Suggestions for Theme

- Make your character evolve to overcome challenges
- Add obstacles to test your hero’s ability to leap into action
- Deduct points for anything going out of bounds
- Duck, dip, dive, and dodge an enemy that’s changing or moving rapidly
- Take place in the year 2020, the next leap year

### Choice of Tech Stack

We've chosen to start with p5.js, since we wanted an abstraction over the canvas API.
We considered Phaser and p5 and opted for p5, being the one with a gentler learning curve.

## OBJECTIVES

- [ ] Build a parallax world with a sprite that appears to move on arrow key input
